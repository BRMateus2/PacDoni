Blinky:
	Of all the ghosts, this one’s the easiest to describe. In Chase Mode, Blinky’s target is Pac-Man,
	and the ghost will hunt the player constantly until its pattern switches to Scatter Mode and it
	heads back to its corner of the maze. There is, however a bit of a twist: when there are 20 dots
	left in the maze, Blinky’s speed will increase slightly. Its speed will increase again when there
	are 10 dots left. At these points, Blinky’s behaviour in Scatter Mode will also change; instead of
	moving back to its corner at the top right of the maze, it will continue to chase Pac-Man. This
	behaviour, curiously dubbed 'Cruise Elroy' by players, makes Blinky the most fearsome character
	in the game, since it’ll only switch back to its less speedy, persistent state once the player’s
	either eaten all the dots or lost a life.
